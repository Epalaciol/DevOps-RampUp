# DevOps Ramp-up

## Welcome

DevOps has a wide variety of practices, tools, and methodologies, which enable it to be an important part of an _agile delivery culture_.

This ramp-up is presented as a **series of challenges**. Each challenge is chosen to show beginners the basics of some of the DevOps practices, and it is designed to help us use the same language after its completion. We are tool agnostics, so you can use any tool you like, but we do have a client base that need us to be proficient in some basic AWS concepts.
